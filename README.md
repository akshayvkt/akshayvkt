# 👋 Hi there, I’m Akshay 
- 👀 I’m interested in the potential of clean energy and AI towards creating a radically better future.
- 💻 I’m learning to code, and the goal is to code as frequently as possible. Towards a 🟩 GitHub and to translate these learnings to building products      that are cool and useful.
- 🌐 My webpage is https://akshayvkt.github.io/
- 📫 I can be reached at (vc343 at cornell dot edu)

**Things I've built:**
-  Have a voice-based to-and-fro conversation with Steve Jobs at https://huggingface.co/spaces/akshayvkt/talk-To-SteveJobs
- 🙏🏽 If you could ask the Bhagavad Gita a question, what would you ask? https://gita-gpt.streamlit.app/
- 📝 Go from product ideas to generating product documents in seconds here: https://productaize.up.railway.app/
