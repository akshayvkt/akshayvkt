# 👋 Hi there, I’m Akshay 
- 👀 I’m interested in the potential of clean energy and AI towards creating a radically better future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code and aspire to translate these learnings towards building products that are useful to a large number of people.
- ⚡ I work as a Product Owner at SunPower, where I'm working to 📈 our residential energy storage fleet to hundreds of thousands of homes. 
- 💞️ Starting 10/12/2022, the goal is to code every single day. Towards a 🟩 GitHub. 
- 📫 I can be reached at (vc343 at cornell dot edu)
