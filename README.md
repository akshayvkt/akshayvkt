# 👋 Hi, I’m Akshay
- 👀 I’m interested in the potential of clean energy and AI towards creating a radically better future.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn to code and as I go, I aspire to keep building.
- ⚡ I work as a Product Owner at SunPower, where I'm working to scale📈 our residential energy storage fleet to hundreds of thousands of homes. 
- 💞️ I aim to code every single day (as of 10/12/22) to be able to build useful software products.
- 📫 I can be reached at (vc343 at cornell dot edu)
