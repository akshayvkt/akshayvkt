# 👋 Hi there, I’m Akshay 
- 👀 I’m interested in the potential of AI and clean energy towards creating a radically better future.
- 💻 I’m learning to code, and the goal is to code as frequently as possible. Towards a 🟩 GitHub and to translate these learnings to building products      that are cool and useful.
- 🌐 My webpage is https://akshayvkt.github.io/
- 📫 I can be reached at (vc343 at cornell dot edu)

**Things I've built:**

- 🖼️ Cando is an AI that remembers and helps you make progress towards your goals. https://cando-11bd85eccaa6.herokuapp.com/
- 🖼️ chatGPT-StableDiffusion plugin to let the LLM wordcel generate and edit images for you https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1645244964564250626
- 🙏🏽 If you could ask the Bhagavad Gita a question, what would you ask? https://gita-gpt.streamlit.app/
