# 👋 Hi there, I’m Akshay 
- 👀 I’m interested in the potential of clean energy and AI towards creating a radically better future.
- 💻 I’m learning to code, and the goal is to code as frequently as possible. Towards a 🟩 GitHub and to translate these learnings to building products      that are cool and useful.
- ⚡ I work as a Product Owner at SunPower, where I'm working to 📈 our residential energy storage fleet to hundreds of thousands of homes. 
- 📫 I can be reached at (vc343 at cornell dot edu)
- 🌐 My webpage which was my first coding project is https://akshayvkt.github.io/
- 📝 Go from product ideas to generating product documents in seconds here: https://productaize.vercel.app/
- 🙏🏽 Ask any question or moral dilemma you have and let Bhagvad Gita help you out, just ask! https://gita-gpt.streamlit.app/
